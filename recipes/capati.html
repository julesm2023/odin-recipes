            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <b><p>5 cups all-purpose flour (not self-rising)</p>
                <p>2 cups warm water</p>
                <p>1 ½ teaspoon Salt</p>
                <p>
                     ½ cup Canola/Vegetable oil (heated then cool down)
                    You will not use all of it.</p>
                    <P>2 cups Extra flour for kneading</P></b>
        <h3>
            MAKE THE DISH
    
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1. In a large mixing bowl, measure 5 cups of flour.</li>
                <li>2. In another bowl, mix salt, 3 tablespoons of oil, and 1 ½ cup of water, stir until the salt dissolves.</li>
                    <li>3. Pour mixture in the flour bowl. Mix well; and add the remaining water until dough becomes soft.</li>
                        <li>4. Knead the dough for 10 – 15 minutes; add flour if needed.</li>
                            <li>5. Divide in 11 to 15 equal parts (make a ball like shape), arrange them on a flat surface, and then cover with
plastic wrap or a white clean cloth.</li>
<li>6. Remove ball and place on flat surface sprinkled lightly with flour. Dust rolling pin with flour to keep it form
sticking. With a rolling pin, roll the dough thinner than ¼ centimeters (it’s okay if it’s not perfectly round).</li>
<li>7. Brush oil on top.</li>
    <li>8. On the side facing you, make one centimeter fold, then roll forward with both two hands.</li>
        <li>9. Make four. You will roll the rest as you are cooking.</li>
            <li>10. Heat a non-stick pan on medium heat (use a round pancake pan). After it is heated, sprinkle a few drops of
water on it. If the drops dry right away, the pan is ready.</li>
<li>11. Place the chapati you have just rolled on a heated pan. After about a minute, check the bottom of the
chapati, if it is golden brown, and the top is translucent, flip it over.</li>
<li>12. Brush a little bit of oil on the top of the chapati, then check to see if the bottom is cooked and is golden brown.</li>
    <li>13. If yes, flip the chapati over again, now brush the oil on the second side of the chapati, and turn it over again.</li>
        <li>14. After about 30 seconds remove the chapati from the pan and put it on a plate and cover with a foil paper.</li>
        </ul>
